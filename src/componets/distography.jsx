        <p className="dist-text">I started writing songs at a young age, learning guitar chords from a small waterlogged book and looping cricket sounds on my dad's computer. Gradually, I began to experiment more with recording, and at some point, the music and the artistry took off together. I started creating projects with more intention and personal significance. Through digitally manipulating the quiet background sounds in my bedroom, Iâ€™ve found many new ways of making my internal world a bit more tangible.</p>
